# Kodak DC20 C#

This was going to be a fresh full implementation of the Kodak DC20 protocol (almost done, needs big cleaning but works well enough) as well as the raw to TGA converter.

The raw converter, found here: https://github.com/nickandrew/dc20 is of unknown license and my port of it to C# was very lazy. (Just wanted to get it done at this point).
